scrabble task 
1. round: individual
2. round: pairs
3. round: individual 

changes? 
parameters:
- time
- no. of words
- word similarity
- strategy (foraging patterns)

group members
diverse, but still some similarity 
is it good to be mostly similar or diverse? 
- dependent on task
- what is it that we want to measure 
- no of different(!) words - high number- very different words, low difference - very similar words. 

group performance
- look at the benefit (not the actual "product"?)
- this experiment: highest no of words as baseline (alternatively: use the joined/added/merged participants words as baseline. the added group performance -> nomial groups?) 
- 

How to check for cognitive diversity? 
- total number of different words created
- strategy (e.g. number of non-words as a strategy to lighten cognitive load - new combinations)


- cognitive diversity
- performance similarity 

other experiments
- shared (working memory) vs. individual based on cognitive strategy (make up a story, repetition, etc.)
- game theory (play against computer, primed by strategy, play together with person that has either same or different priming - see how it affects performance)
- cogwheel game - they have been running an experiment where they did something alike. The pilot showed that a version where you first do 10 trials indivdidually (develop expertise) and then go together with another for 10 other results in a better performance than if you just are together from the start in all 20 trials. Then you are more primed by the partners strategy from the beginning. 

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
